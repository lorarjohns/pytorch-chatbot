A work-in-progress. Currently a very rudimentary chat bot.

## Author

üë§ **Lora Johns**

## Data

The Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus

- 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters
- 9,035 characters from 617 movies
- 304,713 total utterances

## Models

This chatbot implements a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with an encoder based on Cho et. al.'s dual Gated Recurrent Unit model and a decoder that incorporates Luong's attention mechanism.

TO DO:

- Implement pretrained word embeddings with torchtext instead of this dinky dictionary that can't handle out-of-vocabulary words!
- I have a function for generating random circulant embeddings that would go here nicely, as well.
- Ngrams would be neat.
- Different data.
- TBD.
